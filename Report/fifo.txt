First FIFO try, common clock domain for read and write (working post route simulation):
Clock is connected to 100 MHz User Clock

entity fifo_tl is PORT (
    clk_i : IN STD_LOGIC; --- mapped to user clock (FPGA reference X1)
    rst_i : IN STD_LOGIC; -- mapped to C (center button)
    din_i : IN STD_LOGIC_VECTOR(7 DOWNTO 0); -- mapped to GPIO DIP Switches
    wr_en_i : IN STD_LOGIC; -- mapped to SW 10 (upper button)
    rd_en_i : IN STD_LOGIC; -- mapped to SW 11 (lower button)
    dout_o : OUT STD_LOGIC_VECTOR(7 DOWNTO 0); -- mapped to gpio LEDs
    full_o : OUT STD_LOGIC; -- error LED
    empty_o : OUT STD_LOGIC; -- error LED

Second FIFO try, two different clock domains for read and write (working post route simulation available)
entity FIFO_asynch_tl is PORT (
		 rst_i : IN STD_LOGIC;
		 wr_clk_i : IN STD_LOGIC;
		 rd_clk_i : IN STD_LOGIC;
		 din_i : IN STD_LOGIC_VECTOR(7 DOWNTO 0);
		 wr_en_i : IN STD_LOGIC;
		 rd_en_i : IN STD_LOGIC;
		 dout_o : OUT STD_LOGIC_VECTOR(7 DOWNTO 0);
		 full_o : OUT STD_LOGIC;
		 empty_o : OUT STD_LOGIC;
		 valid_o : OUT STD_LOGIC;
		 underflow_o : OUT STD_LOGIC;
		 rd_data_count_o : OUT STD_LOGIC_VECTOR(15 DOWNTO 0);
		 wr_data_count_o : OUT STD_LOGIC_VECTOR(15 DOWNTO 0)
	  );
end FIFO_asynch_tl;

Write clock is connected to 100 MHz User Clock,
read clok is connected to 33 MHz clock generator. 
(details in data sheet, p. 19/20)

Fifo from 13.4 and Microblaze 13.1 cause an error in SDK:
MicroBlaze is under reset..
(checking out, if the error is due to different ISE versions)
