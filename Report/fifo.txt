First FIFO try, common clock domain for read and write (working post route simulation):

entity fifo_tl is PORT (
    clk_i : IN STD_LOGIC; --- mapped to user clock (FPGA reference X1)
    rst_i : IN STD_LOGIC; -- mapped to C (center button)
    din_i : IN STD_LOGIC_VECTOR(7 DOWNTO 0); -- mapped to GPIO DIP Switches
    wr_en_i : IN STD_LOGIC; -- mapped to SW 10 (upper button)
    rd_en_i : IN STD_LOGIC; -- mapped to SW 11 (lower button)
    dout_o : OUT STD_LOGIC_VECTOR(7 DOWNTO 0); -- mapped to gpio LEDs
    full_o : OUT STD_LOGIC; -- error LED
    empty_o : OUT STD_LOGIC; -- error LED

	 data_count_o : OUT STD_LOGIC_VECTOR(15 DOWNTO 0) -- not mapped
