Port Connection of Microblaze:
General Control Ports (clock, reset)
Input Port from FIFO: Interrupt (fifo full), data (16 Bit bus), both on same channel
Output to Fifo: read enable


DMA: http://www.xilinx.com/support/documentation/ip_documentation/xps_central_dma.pdf

The operation of the XPS Central DMA is initiated by writing values into the following DMA registers:
• Source Address register (SA): The source address for the transfer is written into this register.
• Destination Address register (DA): The destination address for the transfer is written into this register.
• DMA Control Register (DMACR): The parameters of the DMA transfer are controlled by setting the following
values in this register.
• Source Increment (SINC): SINC should be set to ’0’, if and only if the Source Address register is written
with a keyhole address such that a single address is associated with a sequence of data.
Note: An example of a keyhole address is a memory mapped FIFO that maps as an element at a single address but
can consume or produce an endless sequence of data. A variation on a keyhole address is a wide keyhole where a
number of consecutive addresses map to the element. When SINC = ’0’, XPS Central DMA will perform all read
transactions to the same address. It is the responsibility of the corresponding slave to impose a keyhole behavior. For
bursts, this implies that the slave will not increment the keyhole address during the burst or will make the keyhole at least
as wide as the burst size. It is not feasible to use SINC = ’0’ with a non-keyhole slave such as a memory. Even though
the DMA Controller would deliver a non-incremented address during the address phase of PLB transactions, the
memory would increment it during bursts. (See also DINC, which is subject to the same considerations when set to ’0’.)
• If the source address should increment for each data transferred, SINC should set to ’1’.
• Destination Increment (DINC): DINC should be set to ’0’ if and only if the Destination Address is written
with a keyhole address such that a single address is associated with a sequence of data.
Note: See the note for SINC = ‘0’ above. The case DINC = ‘0’ has the same considerations except for the destination
address.
• If the destination address should increment for each data transferred, DINC should set to ’1’.

The data transfer starts by reading data from the source address into an internal FIFO followed by the transfer of
data from the FIFO to the destination address. This repeats until all the data is moved. The DMA Status Registers
get updated as the DMA operation progresses.
While it is moving data as the bus master, the XPS Central DMA Controller attempts to move data efficiently. It
utilizes burst transactions where possible.
The status of the DMA operation is available in the DMA Status Register (DMASR). The DMABSY bit equal to ’1’
represents that a DMA operation is underway. When equal to ’0’, it represents the completion of a DMA transfer.
Alternatively, the DMA Done (DD) interrupt can be used to detect when a DMA operation is complete.
If an error condition is detected during a bus transfer, the DMA operation will be aborted at its current point of
progress. The error is reported through the DMA Error (DE) interrupt condition and the DMA Bus Error (DBE)
status bit.

Reading via DMA from FIFO:
Idea: FIFO generates interrupt when it is full, CPU writes amount of data to be read to DMA (start reading process) and sets read enable to one. --> DMA has to read from FIFO in every clock cycle. If that is not possible, a seperate read impulse generator module can be used to generate the necessary write enable signal.


Mapping:
If manual mapping needs to be done, there can occur some errors if ISE mapped e.g. the DDR2 before:
"Incompatible IOB's are locked to the same bank"..."Conflicting IO Standards" 

Solution: http://www.xilinx.com/support/answers/30772.htm (error is caused the standards that are set by default. if any information will be put into the manual ucf-file, they will override the automatically generated file)
