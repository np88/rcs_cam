Synthesis:
To have the translate part run correctly, I needed to include the fifo_X.ngc file

Problems with ISE:
* Philipp's tutorial is ONLY for ISE 13.1. ISE 13.4 works different for some parts. (E.g. Board is not supported and HW needs to be added, not removed)
* FPGA Board xupv5-lx110t is not supported by ISE 13.4. So to get the pin out automatically, the project should be created using ISE 13.1 (this is particulary important for the DDR2 controller as it is basically impossible to get all the settings and the pinput right that is done by ISE). For 13.1 it is not really  obvoius how to connect the interrupts and the interrupt controller. So the Board support package could not be created properly and there was an include problem in the SDK (xil_cache.h could not be found). Tried using ISE 13.4 for connecting the interrupts to the controller and exporting the project to SDK solved the problem. But there was another problem doing it this way: After programming the FPGA the program would not start and produce following error:

So what actually needs to be done to connect the interrupts and the interrupt sources in 13.1 and earlier:
"Once you have instantiated all peripherals, you will have to configure which of them
generate interrupts. This can be done within the tab Ports of the System Assembly
View panel. Click, on the Net column, the intr property of the interrupt controller (i.e.,
xps intc 0) (the properties will show up by clicking on the plus sign next the peripheral’s
name), a dialog window opens up where you can select interrupt sources and prioritize
them according to the requirements or needs. Further, at this point, we need to create a
connection between the interrupt controller and the MicroBlaze processor, such that the
interrupt controller can communicate the processor that an interrupt has occurred. To
this end, select the interrupt controller again in the Ports tab of the System Assembly
View panel. Then select its Irq property and choose New Connection from the scroll-
down list. Now, select the processor (i.e., microblaze) from the list of components in
the Ports tab, and set its INTERRUPT property to the signal created for the interrupt
controller. This signal’s name should be something like xps intc irq 0 and should appear
in the scroll-down list." (Excerpt from HLD lab ex. 2 description)

BUT: You need to right-click on the header panel and activate "Net" so that it actually will be displayed! Otherwise it might take quite a lot of time looking for it. 


Synthesis:
If some ports are left open because they are not needed, this can cause errors during synthesis. There might be the mistake that not only those ports are unconnected which are supposed to be unconnected but some other unexpected ports, too. This can be resolved by connecting the unneeded ports to some dummy ports. (reading warnings might help here if the architecture does not work as expected).
Another problem can occur, if submodule files are missing. Pins belonging to those modules can be tied to ground and the modules are simply not working at all.

It is important to connect all the IOs in the top level to HW pins if they are used in the design. Otherwise there can be errors like: Microblaze is under reset, unable to stop

No spaces in SDK pathes, causes problems (it even tells you, that it does not work properly, if path contains spaces..)
