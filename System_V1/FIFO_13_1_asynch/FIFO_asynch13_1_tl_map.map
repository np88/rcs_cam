Design Summary
--------------

Design Summary:
Number of errors:      0
Number of warnings:    2
Slice Logic Utilization:
  Number of Slice Registers:                    85 out of  69,120    1%
    Number used as Flip Flops:                  85
  Number of Slice LUTs:                         51 out of  69,120    1%
    Number used as logic:                       51 out of  69,120    1%
      Number using O6 output only:              51

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:                    43 out of  17,280    1%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:           96
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:            11 out of      96   11%
    Number with an unused LUT:                  45 out of      96   46%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:          40 out of      96   41%
    Number of unique control sets:              15
    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:              23 out of  69,120    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
  OVERMAPPING of BRAM resources should be ignored if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-BRAM resource or if placement fails.

IO Utilization:
  Number of bonded IOBs:                        49 out of     640    7%
    Number of LOCed IOBs:                       23 out of      49   46%

  Number of BlockRAM/FIFO:                       1 out of     148    1%
    Number using BlockRAM only:                  1
    Total primitives used:
      Number of 18k BlockRAM used:               1
    Total Memory used (KB):                     18 out of   5,328    1%
