Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:                   116 out of  17,280    1%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:          322
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:            58 out of     322   18%
    Number with an unused LUT:                 111 out of     322   34%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:         153 out of     322   47%

    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:              28 out of  69,120    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
  OVERMAPPING of BRAM resources should be ignored if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-BRAM resource or if placement fails.
